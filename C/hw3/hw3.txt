HW3

This assignment tells the minimum and maximum values for primitives in the C programming language

To run this in a terminal (using the gcc compiler):

	- place both hw3.c and hw3_test.c in your working directory
	
	- type: gcc -o hw3 hw3.c hw3_test.c and press enter
	
	- type: ./hw3 <0/1> <0/1> <c/s/d/l/z>(where the first arg is for signed or unsigned, the second arg is for minimum or maximum and the third arg is the primitive type)
	
	Examples:
		./hw3 0 0 d
		output: 0
		
		./hw3 1 0 d
		Output: -2147483648

		./hw3 0 1 d 
		Output: 4294967295

		./hw3 1 1 d
		Output: 2147483647
