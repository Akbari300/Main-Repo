HW1

This assignment simply gets the greatest common denominator of two variable

To run this in a terminal (using the gcc compiler):

	- place both hw1.c and hw1_test.c in your working directory
	
	- type: gcc -o hw1 hw1.c hw1_test.c and press enter
	
	- type: ./hw1 <num1> <num2> (where <num1> and <num2> are two numbers you wish to find the gcd of)
