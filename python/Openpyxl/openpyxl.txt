How to get openpyxl working!

1) Download Openpyxl from:

	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/openpyxl
	(located at the bottom of the page file is called openpyxl-2.3.1.tar.gz)

2) Navigate to where the file is downloaded and extract it. This will result in a folder called "dist"

		

3) Move this folder into your python/33/Lib location (in my case C:\Python33\Lib)

4) Now open this folder and there will be a file named "openpyxl-2.3.1.tar" Again you must extract this file here using 7zip. 

5) Navigate to the following directory:
	
	C:\Python33\Lib\dist\openpyxl-2.3.1
	And run the following command "python -i setup.py" 

6) This will complete the install for openpyxl

*** Example Code *** 

from openpyxl import Workbook
wb = Workbook()

# grab the active worksheet
ws = wb.active

# Data can be assigned directly to cells
ws['A1'] = 42

# Rows can also be appended
ws.append([1, 2, 3])

# Python types will automatically be converted
import datetime
ws['A2'] = datetime.datetime.now()

# Save the file
wb.save("Michael_Wilk.xlsx")
